Creating API CRUD using Node JS and express .

CRUD is an acronym that comes from the world of databases. Each letter stands for one type of action that a user can perform on a set of data: Create, Read, Update, and Delete. In relational databases, the four activities match the SQL commands INSERT, SELECT, UPDATE and DELETE.

Itâ€™s possible to apply the CRUD concept to the world wide web and its underlying HTTP protocol. Every URL points to a resource, that is, a set of data. And you can access those with different HTTP verbs: GET, PUT, POST and DELETE. Spoiler alert: these verbs do not match CRUD exactly. But more about that later.
